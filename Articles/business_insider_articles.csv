The new rules of workplace loyalty,https://www.businessinsider.com/workplace-loyalty-corporate-america-dysfunction-employers-employees-att-jobs-2025-9,"Last month,AT&T CEO John Stankeysent an unusually blunt memo to his staff. There was a lot in his 2,500-word missive, but one part really stood out to me. ""Some of you may have started your tour with this company expecting an 'employment deal' rooted in loyalty,"" Stankey said. ""We have consciously shifted away from some of these elements."" It's hardly news that companies have become less loyal to their workers, but I'd never heard the head of a large corporation admit it so publicly, and with so little remorse. In a quick write-up, I described the memo as corporate America's clearest attempt yet to overhaulthe terms of the workplace. The response was overwhelming. I received more than 100 emails and DMs from readers eager to share how their experiences shaped their views on thedeath of loyalty. Many laid the blame on CEOs who chase quarterly profits at the expense of their employees' jobs. Others accused millennials and Gen Zers of being entitled andunwilling to do anythingoutside their job descriptions. The clear consensus, as I heard over and over again, was that the corporate workplace has now devolved into a Lord-of-the-Flies dystopia. One reader, a retired auto executive, put it especially starkly. Companies ""try to give people the perception that they are a 'family' at work, but they'll gut you like a fish and toss you to the sea as soon as the metrics look bad,"" he wrote. ""Employees aren't much better,"" he added, as they're ""looking for the next rung in the ladder and will stab you in the back as they try to climb over your corpse."""

It turned into a nine-month journey: Southern Spain, England, Montenegro, and back to Spain. On paper, it looked like a dream: beaches, new cities, new experiences. But in reality, it included long stretches of loneliness and the ache of watching my peers reachtraditional milestonesI hadn't. Along the way, I chased meaning. I questioned my choices during a cold December in London, where the sun set daily at 3 p.m., and when I faced a national blackout alone in Spain, locked out of my apartment in April."

He started looking for full-time employment in November 2022, but said the job market was challenging, in part because he wasn't yet authorized to work in the US — and some employers didn't want to wait for his work authorization to be processed or commit tosponsoring a visain the future.
